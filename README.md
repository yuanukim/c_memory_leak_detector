# c_memory_leak_detector
##### a intrusive way to detect the unreleased memory which are allocated by malloc or calloc, see usage.c to know the usages.
##### C99 is required, and note that, this tool does not supports realloc().
##### I write this tool to detect the memory leak in my own libraries and programs, on linux, valgrind is really good for this, but on windows, I can't find a easy way to do this, that's the purpose of this tool. 
##### you can modify it to fit for your own needs.
